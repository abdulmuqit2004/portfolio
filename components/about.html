                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>I’m a third-year Computer Science student at Ontario Tech University specializing in Data Science. My passion for technology comes from a constant curiosity to learn, build, and solve meaningful problems through code and data.</p> 
                <p>Over the past few years, I’ve developed hands-on experience in software development, data analysis, and automation through both academic projects and real-world work. From leading team-based web applications to optimizing business systems at local organizations, I’ve learned how technology can make a tangible impact.</p>
                <p>I’m continuously growing as a developer — eager to take on challenges, collaborate with others, and apply my skills to create practical solutions that make a difference.</p>
